Hello! My name is christian calayag and welcome to one of my projects. I am an aspiring developer and I am happy you are here. 


This project highlights MERN Authentication as well as other fundumentals of MERN, such as CRUD.

In order for you to run my program you must create a .env file in both client and backend folder. 

_____________________________________________________________

FRONTEND .ENV: 

VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
_____________________________________________________________

BACKEND .ENV:

#DATABASE
MONGODB_URI=""

#WEBTOKEN
JWT_SECRET="seecret//hehe"

#NODE ENVIRONMENT
NODE_ENV='development'

# NODEMAILER
SMTP_USERNAME = ""
SMTP_PASSWORD = "P"

SENDER_EMAIL = "your email here"
_____________________________________________________________

I am also using nodemailer in this project. Hope you find my project working (please do)

If there are any points of improvement, comments, or any helpful insight for me you may contact me at
